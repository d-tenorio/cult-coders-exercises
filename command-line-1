EXERCISE 1

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    🗎file0.txt
    🗎file1.txt
    🗎file2.txt
    📁LEVEL1   <-------------current directory
        📁LEVEL2
        📁LEVEL3
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:

touch file2.txt
mkdir level1
cd level1
mkdir level2
mkdir level3

Now, draw the resulting file structure and an arrow indicating where the current working directory is located.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
EXERCISE 2

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file_to_delete.txt
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

You have two tasks:
    1. Using one command, move the file from LEVEL2 to LEVEL1, keeping the same name. Write this command as your answer.
    ANSWER: mv file_to_delete.txt\ level1\
    2. Using one command, delete the file now located in LEVEL1. Write this command as your answer.
    ANSWER: rm -f file_to_delete.txt

You should have two commands in total.
Hint:
- the mv command is your friend

EXERCISE 3

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        🗎file1.txt
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file2.txt
            
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rm file2.txt

What happens? Why?
ANSWER: It's not executed because its not in the 📁LEVEL1 folder. Its in a subfolder of 📁LEVEL1.

EXERCISE 4
You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        🗎file1.txt
        📁LEVEL3

        
            
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rmdir LEVEL2
mkdir LEVEL3
cd LEVEL3
rm LEVEL3

Draw the resulting file structure. What command(s) did not execute properly and why?
ANSWER: Command rm LEVEL3 did not execute properly because rm is not a command. The right command would be rmdir LEVEL3.
