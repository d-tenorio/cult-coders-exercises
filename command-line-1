EXERCISE 1

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    🗎file0.txt
    🗎file1.txt
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:

touch file2.txt
mkdir level1
cd level1
mkdir level2
mkdir level3

Now, draw the resulting file structure and an arrow indicating where the current working directory is located.

📁ROOT 
    🗎file0.txt
    🗎file1.txt
    🗎file2.txt
    📁level1 <-----
        📁level2
        📁level3



--------------------------------------------------------------------
EXERCISE 2

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file_to_delete.txt
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

You have two tasks:
    1. Using one command, move the file from LEVEL2 to LEVEL1, keeping the same name. Write this command as your answer.
    2. Using one command, delete the file now located in LEVEL1. Write this command as your answer.

You should have two commands in total.
Hint:
- the mv command is your friend

EXERCISE 3

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        🗎file1.txt
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file2.txt
            
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rm file2.txt

What happens? Why?

EXERCISE 4
You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        🗎file1.txt
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file2.txt
            
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rmdir LEVEL2
mkdir LEVEL3
cd LEVEL3
rm LEVEL3

Draw the resulting file structure. What command(s) did not execute properly and why?
