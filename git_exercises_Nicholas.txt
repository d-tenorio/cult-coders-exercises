EXERCISE 1

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    🗎file0.txt
    🗎file1.txt
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:

touch file2.txt
mkdir level1
cd level1
mkdir level2
mkdir level3

Now, draw the resulting file structure and an arrow indicating where the current working directory is located.
📁ROOT
    🗎file0.txt
    🗎file1.txt
    🗎file2.txt
    📁level1<-----
        📁level2
        📁level3

--------------------------------------------------------------------
EXERCISE 2

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file_to_delete.txt
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

You have two tasks:
    1. Using one command, move the file from LEVEL2 to LEVEL1, keeping the same name. Write this command as your answer.
    2. Using one command, delete the file now located in LEVEL1. Write this command as your answer.

You should have two commands in total.
Hint:
- the mv command is your friend

1. git mv file_to_delete.txt 📁LEVEL1
2. git rm -f file_to_delete.txt

EXERCISE 
You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        🗎file1.txt
        📁LEVEL2
            🗎file2.txt
            
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rm file2.txt

What happens? Why?
The current working directory becomes LEVEL1 becuase the command cd tells it to foucus on the directory.
Then file2.txt is deleted with the rm -f command which forcibly deleting the chosen file fomr the repository.

EXERCISE 4
You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1 <---
        🗎file1.txt
        📁LEVEL2 deleted
            🗎file2.txt
            
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rmdir LEVEL2
mkdir LEVEL3
cd LEVEL3
rm LEVEL3

Draw the resulting file structure. What command(s) did not execute properly and why?
📁ROOT
    📁LEVEL1
        🗎file1.txt
        
If in understand correctly the entirty of the level 2 and level 3 directories were deleted by the 
rm commands deleting their files and removing them from the repositroy.
